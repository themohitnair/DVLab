### Steps for Creating the Dashboard:

1. **Import and Prepare Data**:

   - Open Tableau Public and click on **Connect to a File** to import the sales performance dataset.
   - Ensure the dataset has columns for sales, regions, product categories, and date.

2. **Create Visualizations**:

   - **Line Chart (Sales Trends)**:

     - Drag `Date` (set to **Month** or **Quarter**) to **Columns** and `Sales` to **Rows**.
     - Change the visualization type to **Line Chart** to show sales trends over time.

   - **Bar Chart (Sales by Region)**:

     - Drag `Region` to **Columns** and `Sales` to **Rows**.
     - Change the visualization type to **Bar Chart** to compare sales across different regions.

   - **Pie Chart (Sales by Product Category)**:
     - Drag `Product Category` to **Rows** and `Sales` to **Columns**.
     - Change the visualization type to **Pie Chart** and adjust it to show the distribution of sales among different product categories.

3. **Design the Dashboard**:

   - Click **New Dashboard** and drag your visualizations onto the dashboard canvas.
   - Organize the visualizations to ensure a cohesive and easy-to-read layout. Place the line chart for trends at the top and the bar and pie charts in a way that complements the analysis.
   - Add titles, legends, and tooltips for better understanding.

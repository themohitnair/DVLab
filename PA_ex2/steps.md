### Steps for Creating the Dashboard:

1. **Import and Prepare Data**:

   - Open Tableau Public and click on **Connect to a File** to import the customer purchases dataset.
   - Ensure the dataset has columns for customer age, total spending, store location, product sales, and profit margins.

2. **Create Visualizations**:

   - **Scatter Plot**:

     - Drag `Customer Age` to **Columns** and `Total Spending` to **Rows**.
     - Change the visualization type to **Scatter Plot**.
     - Optionally, use `Customer ID` or another dimension for **Color** or **Size** to differentiate data points.

   - **Heat Map**:

     - Drag `Store Location` to **Rows** and `Product Sales` to **Columns**.
     - Change the visualization type to **Heat Map**.
     - Drag `Product Sales` to **Color** in the Marks card to show intensity.

   - **Dual-Axis Chart**:
     - Drag `Date` (set to **Month** or **Quarter**) to **Columns**.
     - Drag `Sales` to **Rows** and `Profit Margins` to the second axis (right-click on the second axis and select **Dual Axis**).
     - Synchronize axes if necessary and adjust the chart type for each axis to make it clearer.

3. **Design the Dashboard**:

   - Click **New Dashboard** and drag your visualizations onto the dashboard canvas.
   - Adjust the layout for readability, ensuring the scatter plot, heat map, and dual-axis chart are displayed clearly.
   - Add titles, legends, and tooltips for context.
